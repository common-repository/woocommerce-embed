This is a plugin that makes products embadable on any website using an iframe. 

== Description ==

This plugin creates an embed button on the product page and/or the cart page to make the products embedable. 
This functions works much like the embed function for example YouTube offers and displays the products in an 
iframe using the original stylesheets.

This plugin is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with marketing of the WooCommerce products in blogs 
and to help affiliates display the products in a better way in affiliate programs(affiliates integration is coming soon).

This plugin was the winning entry at the hackaton as WordCamp Nork√∂ping 2014. 
We want to thank the envent organizers Angry Creative and the sponsors Aftonbladet and Knowit for making this possible.
